Table of Stochastic Dynamic Programming Notation 
================================================

Stochastic dynamic programming and its variants (e.g. Markov Decision Processes, Approximate Dynamic Programming, Reinforcement Learning) is studied by control theorists, operations researchers, and computer scientists. Despite their common indebtedness to [Richard Bellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bellman), each field has developed its own notation(s). 

This document is an attempt to provide a common index between the various notations to help researchers and practitioners interact with the literature across fields.
